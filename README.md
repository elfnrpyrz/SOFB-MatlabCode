# SOFB-MatlabCode

This is a sample code I implemented to collect data from children in person. Four different versions exist for different counterbalancing orders for stimuli.
The zip file contains all the necessary sound and picture files to run the experiment. All the files (the .m file and the pics & sounds) need to be within the same folder directory in order for the experiment to run without any errors.
